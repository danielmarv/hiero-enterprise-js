/**
 * Delete Token — mark an existing token as deleted on the network.

 * requires the token's admin key — pass it via `additionalSigners`. The
 * token must have been created with an `adminKey` set, otherwise the
 * token is immutable and cannot be deleted. Once deleted, the token
 * cannot be used for any operation (transfers, mints, associations, etc.).
 *
 * Note: `TokenDelete` is not whitelisted for scheduling on the network,
